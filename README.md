# ATP-in-Lean

Formalization of the ATP Lecture and Exercises

Proposed strategy:

- if theorem/definition is available in mathlib, use it and write down the name
- if lecture uses different definition than mathlib, proof equivalence, but use mathlib version onwards
- attempt to implement the paper.pdf and most of the exercise sheets
- interesting theorems or examples can be reimplemented for fun
